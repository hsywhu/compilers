# Introdunction

---
This is a simple grammar analyzer.It can help you justify which type of grammar it is by analyzing your inputs.

##How to use
At first you will be asked to input a name for the grammar you are going to analyze.

Secondly you should input the Nonterminal Symbols and the Production Rules.

The Terminal Symbols have been set beforehand, ands you can easily do some change of that at the very beginning of the code.

##Example
I can show you an example.

The name of the grammar is **G[S]**, and the Nonterminal Symbols contents **A,B,C,D**. The production rules are:

```
A::=xB
A::=yC
B::=zB
B::=yC
C::=xD
D::=yD
D::=x
```

The result shows like this:

##Note
Be careful to split the Production Rules with a **Comma** and type **Enter** when you finish.
